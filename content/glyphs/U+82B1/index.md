[艸](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/140/#U%2b8278) *GRASS* + ♪[化](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/21/#U%2b5316) \*HUA. Created as a shortening of [華](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/140/#U%2b83EF) (in the Eastern Han the words {華} \*qʷʰˤra \> \*ɣua "flower" and {化} \*qʷʰˤrajs \> \*huaᶜ became similar).
