{一萬} \*ʔit tV.ma\[n\]s "one myriad" → {萬} \*tV.ma\[n\]s "myriad"

Initially the word {萬} was written phonetically with a glyph created
for the word {蠆} \*mə.r̥ˤa\[t\]s "scorpion" (depiction of a scorpion)
(compare it's usage as ♪萬 \*RAT in e.g. 厲 for {礪} \*rats
"whetstone"). The glyph 一 "one" was added to represent the compound
{一萬}, giving the ligature 萬. Later this ligature began to be used for
the morpheme {萬} itself.
