{牽} \*\[k\]ʰˤi\[ŋ\] "to pull"

Initially the word {牽} was written as [𮕧](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/145/#U%2b2E567) (depiction of a hand ([又](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/29/#U%2b53C8)) pulling on clothes ([衣](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/145/#U%2b8863))). Later ♪[矛](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/110/#U%2b77DB) \*KRIŊ was added, and [又](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/29/#U%2b53C8) was changed to [手](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/64/#U%2b624B) *HAND* and then distorted to 牛.
