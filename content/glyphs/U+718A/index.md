{熊} \*\[t.w\]əm "bear" or {熊(熊)} \*\[t.w\]əm "flaming" ♪→ {熊}
\*\[t.w\]əm "bear"

Initially the word {熊} "bear" was written as 能 or a similar glyph
(depiction of a bear). Later an unknown element was added (\> 大). The
modern character comes either from the distortion 大 \> 火 with shifting
it to the bottom, or from the shortening of the glyph ⿱⿱大能火 (火
*FIRE* + ♪⿱大能(熊) \*WƏM) for {熊(熊)} "flaming".
