{兵} *bīng* "soldier" ♪→ {𰻞(𰻞麵)} *biáng*(*biáng miàn*) "*biangbiang* noodles"

From a Hongmen society secret Taoist talisman-like symbol composed of 戀 "to long for", 汨 "Ming dynasty", 戈 "spear; weapon", 馬 "people" (southeastern secret societies slang) and two 長 "long", conveying meanings "to long for the Ming" and "strong weapons and sturdy horses/people, as well as long-devoted members of the organization". Later 穴 (comes either from 共 \< 洪 as in 洪門 "Hongmen" or from distorted 雨 "rain" from typical Taoist characters or talismans) was added and 戈 was changed to a synonymoys 刀/刂 "knife".
