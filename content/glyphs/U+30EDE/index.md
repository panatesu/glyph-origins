{兵} *bīng* "soldier" ♪→ {𰻞(𰻞麵)} *biáng*(*biáng miàn*) "*biangbiang* noodles"

From a Hongmen society secret Taoist talisman-like symbol composed of [戀](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/61/#U%2b6200) "to long for", [汨](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/85/#U%2b6C68) "Ming dynasty", [戈](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/62/#U%2b6208) "spear; weapon", [馬](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/187/#U%2b99AC) "people" (southeastern secret societies slang) and two [長](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/168/#U%2b9577) "long", conveying meanings "to long for the Ming" and "strong weapons and sturdy horses/people, as well as long-devoted members of the organization". Later 穴 (comes either from 共 \< [洪](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/85/#U%2b6D2A) as in 洪門 "Hongmen" or from distorted [雨](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/173/#U%2b96E8) "rain" from typical Taoist characters or talismans) was added and [戈](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/62/#U%2b6208) was changed to a synonymoys [刀](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/18/#U%2b5200) "knife".
