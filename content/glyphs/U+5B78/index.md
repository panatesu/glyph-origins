{學} \*m.kˤruk "to study" & {教} \*s.\[k\]ˤraw "to teach"

Initially the word {學} was written as [⿱𦥑宀](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/215/#%E2%BF%B1%F0%A6%A5%91%E5%AE%80) or [⿱宀𠬞](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/215/#%E2%BF%B1%E5%AE%80%F0%A0%AC%9E) ([宀](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/40/#U%2b5B80) *ROOM* + [𦥑](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/134/#U%2b26951)/[𠬞](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/29/#U%2b20B1E) ♪\*KUK (depiction of both hands holding something for {掬} \*kuk "to hold with both hands")). Later ♪[爻](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/89/#U%2b723B)/㐅 \*KAW used for {教} was added, fusing the glyphs so it could be used for both words {學} and {教}. Later [子](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/39/#U%2b5B50) *CHILD* was added. After the glyph [教](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/66/#U%2b6559) was created, 學 began to be used only for {學}.
