{一百} \*ʔit pˤrak "one hundred" → {百} \*pˤrak "hundred"

Initially the word {百} was written phonetically as [白](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/106/#U%2b767D) \*PAK. The glyph [一](https://panatesu.github.io/glyph-origins/radicals/1/#U%2b4E00) *ONE* was added to represent the compound {一百}, giving the ligature 百. Later this ligature began to be used for the morpheme {百} itself.
